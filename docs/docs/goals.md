#Goals
Developed with the following goals in mind

* [Easy to use](#easy-to-use)
* [Runtime agnostic](#runtime-agnostic)
* [Memory efficient](#memory-efficient)
* [Non blocking](#non-blocking)
* [Dependency free](#dependency-free)

##Easy to use 
familiar API and sensible defaults. 

##Runtime Agnostic
API layer must be pure Kotlin

##Memory efficient
Trying to reduce the overhead as much as possible

##Non blocking
besides being thread safe everything should be non blocking (JVM)

##Dependency free
when not counting kotlin std
